I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Professor Tengyao Wang](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/wangt60/) and [Professor Yining Chen](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/cheny100/). Before that, I received my M.Phil. in Statistics and B.Sc. in Mathematics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).
