I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics) at [London School of Economics (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). Before that, I received my M.Phil. in Statistics and B.Sc. in Mathematics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html).

My research interests are change point detection, asymptotic variance estimation and statistical learning. I am particularly keen on creating statistical methods with theoretical guarantee and building handy software packages.
